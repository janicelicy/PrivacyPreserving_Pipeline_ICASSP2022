Change Log
========================

Version 1.0, released on 30/03/2017

Version 1.1, released on 12/06/2018: 
We supplement the bounding box of the target face in each image. And some mistakenly aligned images have been corrected.

IMAGE
=========================

-----------------------------------------Subfile 1: original.zip-----------------------------------------

containing 12271 training samples and 3068 testing samples.

Notes:
1. Images are named in the format of "train_XXXXX.jpg" / "test_XXXX.jpg".

-----------------------------------------Subfile 2: aligned.zip-----------------------------------------

containing 12271 training samples and 3068 testing samples after aligned. 

Notes:
1. Images are named in the format of "train_XXXXX_aligned.jpg" / "test_XXXX_aligned.jpg";
2. Images are first roughly aligned using similarity transformation according to the two eye locations and the center of mouth;
3. Images are then resized to 100*100.


=========================
ANNOTATION
=========================

-----------------------------------------Subfile 1: auto.zip-----------------------------------------

containing 37 landmark location labels detected by Face++ API for each samples.

Notes:
1. In "train_XXXXX_auto_attri.txt" / "test_XXXX_auto_attri.txt", each row presents location info (x, y) of one landmark.

-----------------------------------------Subfile 2: manual.zip-----------------------------------------

containing 5 landmark location labels (the central of two eyes, the tips of the nose and two corners of the mouth) and other attribute labels (gender, race and age) manually annotated by our experimenters.

Notes:
1. In "train_XXXXX_manu_attri.txt" / "test_XXXX_manu_attri.txt", the first five lines contain location info (x, y) of 5 landmarks.
The next three lines presents information of gender, race and age attributes respectively:
	Gender
	0: male		1: female	2: unsure
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Race	
0: Caucasian		1: African-American		2: Asian
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Age (5 ranges)	
0: 0-3	 1: 4-19		2: 20-39		3: 40-69		4: 70+
----------------------------------------------------------------------


=========================
EMOTION_LABEL
=========================

Notes:
1: Surprise
2: Fear
3: Disgust
4: Happiness
5: Sadness
6: Anger
7: Neutral
